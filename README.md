COSC422 Skeletel Animation Assignment (Assignment 2)

![Example Image.](./Example.png)

Compiling:
----
On Windows it will compile in Visual Studio 2015. Open the .sln file and make sure the nupengl and assimp packages from nuget are installed and it should run.

Untested on Linux, but as has no Windows specific features it should run fine.

Running:
----
Ensure that the objects directory is located in the current working directory (usually same as executable) and run the program as normal.

Why Is There Only One Program?
----
Yes, the assignment called for two but instead I made them both run simaltaneously from the same executable.

License:
----
Licensed under the MIT license and other applicable licenses where stated.
